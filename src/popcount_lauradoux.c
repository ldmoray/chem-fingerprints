/**
 * Count the number of 1 bits (population count) in a fingerprint
 * using 64-bit tree merging. This implementation uses only 8
 * operations per 8 bytes on 64-bit CPUs.
 * The algorithm is due to CÃ©dric Lauradoux, it is described and
 * benchmarked against other bit population count solutions (lookup
 * tables, bit-slicing) in his paper:

     to CHEMFP_ALIGN8_SMALL. You might think it best to use the
     fastest algorithm, but if you are using Lauradoux then you are on
     a machine which doesn't have POPCNT and where Lauradoux is faster
     than the lookup table. That's the same type of machine where
     Gillies is also faster than a lookup table.

     Calling it here instead of through the the function table saves
     time. It's 0.5% faster on my Mac (with gcc) and 5% faster on a
     Windows box (with msvc 10). */
