   C implementation derived directly from heapq.py in Py2.3 which was
   written by Kevin O'Connor, augmented by Tim Peters, annotated by
   FranÃ§ois Pinard, and converted to C by Raymond Hettinger.

I'm only using a few of the functions from that module. For those, I stripped
out the dependencies on Python's data structures and changed it to take
user-defined comparison and swap functions. Those are gloss; the code hasn't
really changed at all.
