This Python/C extension is reasonably well separated between
the core operations in C, and the interface code to the
Python API. I have the idea that the C code can be made
available as an independent API, so you can call it from
something other than Python.

That was last done a long time ago, and the C API has
changed enough that the current test driver doesn't work.
Still, there might be enough here to get you started.
