The thoughts, ideas, help, and support of many people
went into making this project. In no particular order
they are:

Noel O'Boyle: I used his cinfony code as the base to
understand how the different projects generate fingerprints.
He also encouraged me to develop these tools and put
them out to the world.

Geoff Hutchison for pointing out that he most often
works with small data sets, and human-readable/text
formats are more important than a binary format which
is designed for million-compound data sets. (Thinking
about this was the source for developing both a text
and a binary format.)

The OpenBabel developers, for developing a widely
used tool in cheminformatics with both hash and
substructure fingerprints.

Greg Landrum, for RDKit and for discussions about
what's needed in a fingerprint format. I hope some
day to include some features he needs, like sparse
and count fingerprints.

OpenEye, for a non-commercial license to their tools.

To you, for reading this list and using the code.
