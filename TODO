Include Indigo and CDK support

I think people will want a way to specify a pattern file as
input. Perhaps "--patterns"? One concern is mapping
"ChemFP-Substruct/1" to "ChemFP-Substruct-OpenEye/1", and so on.

Add support for Tversky, Euclidean and other search algorithms

Optimize the multi-query searches (there should be
no need to rescan the arena for each search)

Add support for a "max_score" in doing searches. (This comes from
looking at Pipeline Pilot, which has a default upper limit of
0.999. But frankly, I'm not sure that's useful. I think the point is
to ignore identical hits, so perhaps that's the real requirement.)
