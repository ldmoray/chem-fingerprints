Include Indigo and CDK support

I think people will want a way to specify a pattern file as
input. Perhaps "--patterns"? One concern is mapping
"ChemFP-Substruct/1" to "ChemFP-Substruct-OpenEye/1", and so on.

There should be some way to get a description of each set bit in the
pattern fingerprints.

What about a way to list all of the match atoms which go into a
different bit? That will take a lot of new code, and many of the
fingerprinters don't support it. Perhaps limit it to the pattern
fingerprints?

Add support for Tversky, Euclidean and other search algorithms

Optimize the multi-query searches (there should be
no need to rescan the arena for each search)

Add support for a "max_score" in doing searches. (This comes from
looking at Pipeline Pilot, which has a default upper limit of
0.999. But frankly, I'm not sure that's useful. I think the point is
to ignore identical hits, so perhaps that's the real requirement.)
