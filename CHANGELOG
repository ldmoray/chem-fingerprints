What's new in 1.1 (in development)
==================

New "alignment" option for fingerprint arenas. The default is 8 byte
aligned, which makes for the fastest search performance.

Over a factor of two performance increase for fingerprints which
are 8 byte aligned, using code contributed by Kim Walisch. Also
sped up fingerprints which are 4 byte aligned by 33%.

Support for RDKit's Morgan fingerprints.

Fixed a memory overflow bug which caused crashes on some Windows and
Linux machines.

Added Alex Gr√∂nholm's 'futures' package as a submodule. It greatly
simplifies making a thread- or process pool. It is a backport of the
code in Python 3.2.

Added Nilton Volpato's 'progressbar' package as a submodule. Use it to
show a text-based progress bar in chemfp-based search tools.

Added an experimental "Watcher" module. Use it to handle ^C events,
which otherwise get sent to an arbitary thread. It works by spawning a
child process. The main process listens for a ^C and forwards that as
a os.kill() to the child process. This will likely only work on Unix
systems.


What's new in 1.0
==================

The chemfp format is now a tab-delimited format. I talked with two
people who have spaces in their ids: one in their corporate ids and
the other wants to use IUPAC names. In discussion with others, having
a pure tab-delimited format would not be a problem with the primary
audience.

The simsearch output format is also tab delimited.

Completely redeveloped the in-memory search interface. The core data
structure is a "FingerprintArena", which can optionally hold
population count information.

The similarity searches use a compressed row representation,
which is a more efficient use of memory and reduces the number
Python-to-C calls I need to make.

The FPS knearest search is push oriented, and keeps track of the
identifiers at the C level.

Major restructuring of the API so that public functions are at the top
of the "chemfp" package. Made high-level functions for the expected
common tasks of searching an FPSReader and a FingerprintArena.

The oe2fps, ob2fps, and rdkit2fps readers now support multiple
structure filenames. Each filename is listed on its own "source" line.

New --id-tag to use one of the SD tag fields rather than the title
line. This is needed for ChEBI where you should use --id-tag "ChEBI ID"
to get ids like "CHEBI:776".

New --aromaticity option for oe2fps, and a corresponding "aromaticity"
field in the FPS header.

Improved docstring comments.

Improved error reporting.

Added error handling options "strict", "report", and "ignore."

More comprehensive test suite (which, yes, caught several errors).


What's new in 0.95
==================

Cross-platform pattern-based fingerprint generation, and specific
implementations of a CACTVS/PubChem-like substructure fingerprint and
of RDKit's MACCS patterns.


What's new in 0.9.1
===================

Support for Python 2.5.

What's new in 0.9
=================

Major update from 0.5. Changes to the API, code
cleanup, new search API, and more. Since there are
no earlier users, I won't go into the details. :)
