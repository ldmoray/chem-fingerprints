                       chemfp 1.1p1

A Python library and set of tools for working with cheminformatics
fingerprint data. For more information, see http://chemfp.com/ .

See THANKS for the people who have contributed in some fashion.  (If
I've left your name out or didn't credit you correctly, let me know.)

Install in the normal Python way:

  python setup.py install

You may need a 'sudo' or be root, depending on your system.

If you get a message like:
   unrecognized command line option "-fopenmp"
then your compiler does not understand OpenMP. To compile without
OpenMP append "--without-openmp" to the setup.py line.

If you get a message like:

    cc1: error: invalid option ssse3
   -or-
    cc1: error: unrecognized command line option "-mssse3"

then your compiler does not understand the SSSE3 intrinsics. To
compile without the SSSE3 intrinsics, append "--without-ssse3" to
the setup.py line.

For example, to compile in a Mac with gcc-4.0 using sudo:

  sudo python setup.py install --without-openmp --without-ssse3


Note: chemfp requires a C compiler to build the _chemfp extension.  If
you use Visual Studio for Microsoft Window then you will either need
the 2008 version or you will have to patch your version of Python to
handle 2010 or newer. See http://bugs.python.org/issue13210 .


Documentation? Certainly! Go to:

   https://chemfp.readthedocs.org/en/latest/

or use '--help' on any of the command-line programs:

  rdkit2fps --help
  ob2fps --help
  oe2fps --help
  sdf2fps --help
  simsearch --help

or (for parts of the public API), look at the doc strings

  import chemfp
  help(chemfp)

There are many tests. To run them:

  cd tests
  python unit2 discover
