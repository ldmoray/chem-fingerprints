A Python library and set of tools for working with cheminformatics
fingerprint data.

Copyright under "the MIT license." See COPYING for details.

See THANKS for the people who have contributed in some fashion.

To install:

  python setup.py build
  python setup.py install

You will need a C compiler to build the _chemfp extension.

Documentation? Not yet. Try:

  rdkit2fps --help
  ob2fps --help
  oe2fps --help
  sdf2fps --help

and if you are really adventerous (these are the least tested code)

  simsearch --help
  fpsmerge --help

There are tests.

  cd tests
  python unit2 discover

There's also a tool to validate against the RDMACCS data set. The tool
is undocumented and the code is of developer quality only (meaning, it
has lousy error messages and you have to read the code to figure out
what it's saying).

To run it, if you have OpenBabel, RDKit, and OpenEye installed

  python fpverify.py

otherwise, run the individual tool like this:

  python fpverify.py RDKit
  python fpverify.py OpenEye
  python fpverify.py OpenBabel


Oh, and it creates "tmp.smi" in the local directory and doesn't clean
it up when done.
