This release includes an EXPERIMENTAL C library containing he
fingerprint processing kernal used by the "chemfp" Python module. At
this point the interfact contains no documentation.

The build system is based on cmake. The distribution includes the
cmake-generated Makefile. I will assume you can figure out what that
means.

To build libchemfp go to the "src/" subdirectory and do

   make

The result should be a shared directory for your OS. On my Mac this
builds "libchemfp.dylib".

There is a quick self-test program. To build it

  make test_libchemfp

then run it with

  ./test_libchemfp


The last line should have "Fail: 0", as in

  Pass: 36   Fail: 0

You can read through "test_libchemfp.c" to get some idea of how the
API is supposed to work.


While cmake does include an "install" target, I have never tested it.

The shared libary build should include the version number, as in
"libchemfp-0.9.dylib" but I have not done that.

The goal of this code is to get feedback from you. Do you use the C
code? Is the API sufficient for you or do you need something else?
What else do you need from the build process?
